# INHERITANCE AND POLIMORPHISM

his unit explores Inheritance and Polymorphism to achieve code reusability and dynamic behavior. The focus is on building class hierarchies, understanding static/final modifiers, and implementing interfaces for multiple behaviors.

### 📌 Exercise 1 Level 1— Musical Instruments (Polymorphism)
- Create an abstract class Instrument and three subclasses: WindInstrument, StringInstrument, and PercussionInstrument.
- Implement a polymorphic method play() with specific messages for each type.
- Class Loading: Prove that classes load once using a static block triggered by the first instance or a static member access.

### 📌 Exercise 2 Level 1 — Car Class (Static & Final)
- Create a Car class to differentiate between memory and initialization modifiers:
- Attributes: static final brand, static model, and final power.
- Methods: Contrast a static brake() method with a non-static accelerate() method.


### 📌 Exercise 1 Level 2— Smartphone (Interfaces)
- Combine inheritance and interfaces to model complex objects:
- Base Class: Phone (calling functionality).
- Interfaces: Camera and Clock.
- Subclass: Smartphone, extending the base class and implementing both interfaces to perform all actions.


### 🛠 Technologies
- Java 21 (LTS)
